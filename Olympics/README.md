Many athletes were found to compete in the same event in the same year multiple times

### Predictions
1) USA has earned the most medals and gold medals overall all-time
2) The age group with the most participants will be between 20-30 years old
3) The chances of a Southeast Asian country winning a medal or a gold medal specifically will be less than 0.35

There have always been more male participants than female participants each year in both seasons, but as time has passed, the ratio between both genders participating has lessened towards being equal
